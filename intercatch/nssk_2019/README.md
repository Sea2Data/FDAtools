# Intercatch submission for NSSK

Contains scripts used for produsing SI lines for intercatch submission for NNSK in 2019. Preps BMS under certain assumptions, which will likely not be required for coming year submission. Fleet decompositions (metiers) are merged in from logooks when available. For both logbooks and landing necessary fleet configurations are made in csv files in data/

other configuration of area codes, stocks and metiers are in data/*.csv

data files are not included in repository, but running the code assumes they are in data/

scripts generally assume that the directory where this readme-file is located is the current working directory.
