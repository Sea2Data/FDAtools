# in order to allow unaged-fish (for length and weight models), and filter out ages 0 (for allowing age-range to be set to 1-20):
age != null || age > 0

# && preceeds over || the same way * preceeds over + in arithmatic expressions. So if you want to add more filters to the individual line, you must use parenthesis:
(age != null || age > 0) && length < 200
