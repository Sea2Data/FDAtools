#
# The function Rstox::saveDecomposedCatchMatrix provides estimates for decompositions of landings based on for example quarter and area.
# It can be run after any sucessful eca-run to get estimates tabulated for each of some decomposition variables, for example quarter and area
#
# Decompositions can be made for combinations of columns in landings data.
# In addition some common use cases are supported that are not represented by simple combinations of the columns in landings.
# These are:
# - inclusion of plusgroups in reports, by the integer parameter 'plusgr'
# - inclusion of quarter, by a logical parameter 'addQuarterToDecomp'
# - inclusion of area-combinations, by optional arguments 'customMainAreaGrouping' or 'customLocationGrouping'.
#
# mainarea refer to area coding defined by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries (Hovedomr√•de)
# location refer to location coding defined by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries (Lokasjon)
